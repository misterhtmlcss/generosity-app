# This version is a coffee courtesy app

1. The app keeps track of coffee drinkers and you receive a monthly propotional bill based on your usage. If the total monthly bill is $100 and we serve 10000 coffees then the app will tell you (should you drink a 100 coffees) you owe $1 for the month and to make that donation to the team member in charge of coffee via interac payment.

2. Keeps track of those who do the thankless job of making the coffee, buying the coffee, etc.
